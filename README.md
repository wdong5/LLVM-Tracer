# LLVM-Tracer
An LLVM pass to profile dynamic LLVM IR instructions and runtime values
LLVM IR Trace Profiler (LLVM-Tracer) 2.0
========================================
LLVM-Tracer is an LLVM instrumentation pass to print out a dynamic LLVM IR
trace, including dynamic register values and memory addresses.

Requirements:
-------------------
We *highly* recomend that users use the provided Docker image, available for download
[here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/xyzsam/gem5-aladdin). This will solve
basically all environment issues. If you cannot use Docker, then read on.

  1. LLVM 6.0 and Clang 6.0 64-bit. Users cannot download a pre-built package
     because the Release build type strips value names from LLVM IR, and
     working around this is difficult. Instead, users must built the toolchain
     from source.
  2. GCC 5.4 or later.
  3. CMake 2.8.12 or newer.

Build:
```
docker pull xyzsam/gem5-aladdin
docker run -it --rm --mount source=gem5-aladdin-workspace,target=/workspace xyzsam/gem5-aladdin
```

**Feburary 2020: New features**

## Breaking changes from v1.2 to v2.0: ##

  * LLVM-Tracer now uses LLVM 6.0. Support for all previous versions of LLVM
    have been removed. Minor versions 6.0.0 and 6.0.1 have been tested to work.
  * The Release build type of LLVM 6.0 and Clang 6.0 will strip value names
    from the generated LLVM IR, which breaks the tracer. To avoid this problem,
    it is *highly* recommended that you build the `Debug` build type by adding
    the cmake flag `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`.

## C++ support ##

LLVM-Tracer now supports C++ for uninstrumented code! Users can write C++
to build applications and only have LLVM-Tracer instrument and generate
dynamic traces for the parts that are written in pure C with C-style linkage.
limited to writing pure C programs. Now, you can make use of all the features
For example: if you write a C++ class that calls a function foo which is in an
`extern C` context, you can trace foo(), but you cannot trace a function like
the class's constructor.

See playground/test.cc for a live example.

## Multithreading support ##

LLVM-Tracer can now trace multithreaded applications. Each thread should call
the `llvmtracer_set_trace_name` API first to assign a unique name for the
dynamic trace file that will be produced.

See playground/multithreading.cc for an example.

**Breaking changes from v1.1 to v1.2:**

  * CMake is no longer optional. LLVM-Tracer only supports CMake for building.
    This is because of a new Clangtool component (under `ast-pass/`) which
    requires CMake.
  *  LLVM-Tracer will install all built files to the subdirectories `bin/` and
    `lib/` instead of `full-trace/` and `profile-func/`. The `BUILD_ON_SOURCE`
    option has been removed.

  CMake is a configure tool which allows you to do out-of-source build.
  LLVM-Tracer requires CMake newer than 2.8.12. By default, CMake
  searches for LLVM 6.0.

  1. Set `LLVM_HOME` to where you installed LLVM
     ```
     export LLVM_HOME=/path/to/your/llvm/installation
     export LLVM_HOME=/usr/local/lib
     ```

  2. Clone LLVM-Tracer.

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/ysshao/LLVM-Tracer
     cd LLVM-Tracer/
     ```
  3. Configure with CMake and build LLVM-Tracer source code.

     If you have LLVM installed:
     ```
     mkdir build/
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     make install
     ```

     If you want CMake to install LLVM for you (CAUTION: takes an hour!):
     ```
     mkdir build/
     cd build
     cmake .. -DLLVM_ROOT=/where/to/install/LLVM -DAUTOINSTALL=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
     make
     make install
     ```

  3. (Optional) Try running triad example, which is built by CMake.
     ```
     cd /path/to/build/LLVM-Tracer/
     ctest -V
     ```

  4. Available CMake settings
     ```
     -DLLVM_ROOT=/where/your/llvm/install   (default : $LLVM_HOME)
       You may denote the path of LLVM to find/install by this option. if
       this option is not defined, environment variable LLVM_HOME will be
       used.

     -DAUTOINSTALL=TRUE,FALSE    (default : FALSE)
       By this option, CMake scripts will automatically download, build and
       install LLVM for you if finds no LLVM installation. Using this
       function requires tar-1.22 or newer to extract xz format.

       The default installation path is under /your/build_dir/lib/llvm-x.x.
       You can manually define the installation path by
       -DLLVM_ROOT=/where/to/install.

     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=None,Debug,Release    (default : None)
       It is recommended to use the Debug build type for LLVM 6.0.
     ```


Run:
------
After you build LLVM-Tracer, you can use example triad programs in the example
directory to test LLVM-Tracer.

Example program: triad
----------------------
  1. Go to /workspace/LLVM-Tracer/example/triad
  2. Run LLVM-Tracer to generate a dynamic LLVM IR trace
     a. LLVM-Tracer tracks regions of interest inside a program.
        In the triad example, we want to analyze the triad kernel instead of the setup
        and initialization work done in main. To tell LLVM-Tracer the functions we are
        interested in, set the enviroment variable WORKLOAD to be the top-level function name:

        ```
        export WORKLOAD=triad
        ```

        If you have multiple functions, separate them with commas.

        ```
        export WORKLOAD=md,md_kernel
        ```

        LLVM-Tracer will trace them differently based on the `-trace-all-callees` flag, which can be specified
        to the `opt` command (see step d).

        * If this flag is specified, then any function called by any function in the WORKLOAD variable will be traced.
          This is a simple way to trace multiple "top-level" functions at once.
        * If this flag is not specified, then only functions in the WORKLOAD variable will be traced.

     b. Generate the source code labelmap.

        ```
        export TRACER_HOME=/workspace/LLVM-Tracer
        ${TRACER_HOME}/bin/get-labeled-stmts triad.c -- -I${LLVM_HOME}/lib/clang/6.0/include
        ```

     c. Generate LLVM IR:

        ```
        clang -g -O1 -S -fno-slp-vectorize -fno-vectorize -fno-unroll-loops -fno-inline -emit-llvm -o triad.llvm triad.c
        ```

     d. Run LLVM-Tracer pass.
        Before you run, make sure you already built LLVM-Tracer and have set
        the environment variable `TRACER_HOME` to where you put LLVM-Tracer
        code.

        ```
        opt -S -load=${TRACER_HOME}/lib/full_trace.so -fulltrace -labelmapwriter -trace-all-callees triad.llvm -o triad-opt.llvm
        llvm-link -o full.llvm triad-opt.llvm ${TRACER_HOME}/lib/trace_logger.llvm 
        ```

        The `-trace-all-callees` flag is optional and defaults to false.

     e. Generate machine code:

        ```
        llc -filetype=asm -o full.s full.llvm
        gcc -fno-inline -o triad-instrumented full.s -lstdc++ -lz
        ```

     f. Run binary. It will generate a file called `dynamic_trace` under current directory.

       ```
       ./triad-instrumented
       ```

     g. There is a script provided which performs all of these operations.

       ```
       python llvm_compile.py $TRACER_HOME/example/triad triad
       ```

`triad` is part of the SHOC benchmark suite. We provide a version of SHOC that
is ready to be used with LLVM-Tracer. Please go to
[Aladdin](https://github.com/ysshao/aladdin) and look under the `SHOC`
directory.
